# SCL - Schedule Composer Language

Schedule Composer Language is a SQL-like language for creating recurring schedules.

Eg; 

`
Apply Doug Between '2017-05-01' '2017-05-31 and On Weekdays'
`

Would ensure the Doug is considered to be schedule on any day that is between Monday to Friday for the entire month of may in 2017.

A more formal language definition to come soon.
